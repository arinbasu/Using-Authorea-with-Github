<div>In order to validate causal inference ("X is a cause of Y", for example, "Air Pollution causes Asthma") you will need to first establish that the association is a real association, and then you will need to examine that the nature of such association is one of cause and effect. In order to arrive at a point of real association (i.e., not spurious association), you will need to establish that the association you observe is not due to:</div><ol><li>Chance (we have just stated that you can rule out the play of chance by using p-values and setting up hypotheses testing)</li><li>You will need to eliminate biases</li><li>You will need to control for potential confounding variables.</li></ol><div>The second step is to eliminate biases. Biases are defined as systematic errors in the observation or conduct of a study.
