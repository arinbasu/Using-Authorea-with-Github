<div>In order to validate causal inference ("X is a cause of Y", for example, "Air Pollution causes Asthma") you will need to first establish that the association is a real association, and then you will need to examine that the nature of such association is one of cause and effect. In order to arrive at a point of real association (i.e., not spurious association), you will need to establish that the association you observe is not due to:</div><ol><li>Chance (we have just stated that you can rule out the play of chance by using p-values and setting up hypotheses testing)</li><li>You will need to eliminate biases</li><li>You will need to control for potential confounding variables.</li></ol><div>The second step is to eliminate biases. Biases are defined as systematic errors in the observation or conduct of a study. For a comprehensive review of biases,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-readers/publications/epidemiology-uninitiated/4-measurement-error-and-bias" target="_blank">see this link</a>. For example, Mustafa Al-Zoughool and &nbsp;colleagues conducted a case control study (we will learn about these types of studies later) to test the association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Al_Zoughool_2013}</cite>. In order to study this association, they interviewed &nbsp;1200 lung cancer patients from different hospitals in Montreal over four years, and randomly sampled 1500 people free from lung cancer for the same time period.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
