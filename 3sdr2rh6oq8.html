<div>In order to validate causal inference ("X is a cause of Y", for example, "Air Pollution causes Asthma") you will need to first establish that the association is a real association, and then you will need to examine that the nature of such association is one of cause and effect. In order to arrive at a point of real association (i.e., not spurious association), you will need to establish that the association you observe is not due to:</div><ol><li>Chance (we have just stated that you can rule out the play of chance by using p-values and setting up hypotheses testing)</li><li>You will need to eliminate biases</li><li>You will need to control for potential confounding variables.</li></ol><div>The second step is to eliminate biases. Biases are defined as systematic errors in the observation or conduct of a study. For a comprehensive review of biases,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-readers/publications/epidemiology-uninitiated/4-measurement-error-and-bias" target="_blank">see this link</a>. For example, Mustafa Al-Zoughool and &nbsp;colleagues conducted a case control study (we will learn about these types of studies later) to test the association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Al_Zoughool_2013}</cite>. In order to study this association, they interviewed 44 out of 1200 lung cancer patients from different hospitals in Montreal over four years, and randomly sampled 430 people free from lung cancer for the same time period. They obtained information about exposure to ETS from proxy respondents. What could be a problem about the relationship between ETS and lung cancer if information about exposure to ETS were to be taken like this? The information obtained from the respondents might not be reliable, as those people with lung cancer, if they suspected that ETS were responsible for their lung cancer would be more accurate or would likely &nbsp;to be over cautious in responding or recalling ETS exposure than those in the control arm. As information obtained from these two groups would be different in each arm, this difference is likely to introduce a bias. This bias is referred to as "recall bias" A recall bias is a form of&nbsp;<b>information bias</b>. Other forms of biases are referred to as "selection bias",</div><div></div>
