<div>Epidemiology is defined as the study of the distribution and determinants of health related states and the use of that knowledge to prevent diseases and promote wellness. Environmental epidemiology is a branch of Epidemiology where we study the Environment as a determinant of human health. &nbsp;Environment is a cause of our health and wellness. By "cause" we mean that environmental factors as events or phenomenon precede our health states and are associated with it. Our health states and illnesses are caused by a number of factors and there is no one on one association with a specific environmental correlate and health state. Because of this, we should think of health related states and causes of health related states where causes are components of a larger model and the model with its component causes is the sufficient unit to cause disease. How do determine that an exposure E is a cause of a health outcome O? In order to decide if E is a cause of O, we need to first establish that E has a valid association with O. By valid association, we mean that we should explain that the association we observe between E and O cannot be explained by chance alone, we have to rule out that possibility. We also have to eliminate any possibility of biased observation or reporting that can result in an apparent association between E and O but in reality that association is spurious. We will need to &nbsp;control for any potential or actual confounding variable, that is, a variable that is associated both with E and O, but does not come in any causal pathway connecting the two. After we have established a valid association, we will then evaluate that the nature of this association is one of cause and effect. W</div>
