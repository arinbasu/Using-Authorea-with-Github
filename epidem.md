## Introduction to Epidemiology

Last defined epidemiology as the study of the distribution and determinants of diseases in populations and use of that knowledge to prevent illnesses and promote well being \cite{last2001dictionary}. This suggests that Epidemiology is a population based study and it not only associates with diseases but any health related state. In Epidemiology, we study:

- Cause of diseases
- Measure health related states
- Set up study designs to solve problems
- Analyse data

Cause and causal inference are based on considering that causes of diseases or health related states is not one, but many. These are represented in the form of causal diagrams that are pie shaped figures where each slice of hte pie is formed by one cause that is hypothesised (see Figure 1):

As can be seen in the pie shaped figure, each causal model consists of several possible causes which interact with each other. At the time of causation of the outcome, these factors are all present and are sufficient to cause the outcome. Hence this circle or pie is referred to as a "sufficient" causal diagram. This was first proposed by Ken Rothman \cite{rothman2005causation}.
