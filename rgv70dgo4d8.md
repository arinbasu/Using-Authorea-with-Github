The notion of causal thinking is ingrained in human mind, as Rothman argues that these ideas are formed at birth. A child cries in order to attract the attention of his mother so that it can be fed. This sets up a notion of one on one cause and effect as crying is the trigger that feeds the baby \cite{rothman2005causation}. Over time, this notion of causality becomes ingrained in our mind and forms our intuitive notions of cause and effect.
