The notion of causal thinking is ingrained in human mind, as Rothman argues that these ideas are formed at birth. A child cries in order to attract the attention of his mother so that it can be fed. This sets up a notion of one on one cause and effect as crying is the trigger that feeds the baby \cite{rothman2005causation}. Over time, this notion of causality becomes ingrained in our mind and forms our intuitive notions of cause and effect. However, in Environmental Epidemiology, often multiple events and conditions are causal factors. Often, association between two variables can be non-causal. How do we differentiate whether an explanatory variable is causal as opposed to non-causal? 
The history of the development of causal inference is relatively recent. About 2500 years ago, the world could be explained by the words of experts and seers and these were referred to as [scholasticism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scholasticism). In about the middle of the eighteenth century, a new form of explanatory models arose, referred to as an [inductivism](http://methods.sagepub.com/reference/encyc-of-case-study-research/n171.xml). The inductivist would first observe a particular phenomenon and then from that particular phenomenon, the inductivist would arrive at a theory. Take the case of the old woman who fell and broke her hip. The inductivist would observe that an old woman had slipped and broke her hip and from here, the inductivist would argue that old age combined with slippery surface would lead to hip fracture. John[ Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill) was a proponent of inductive logic. Inductive logic was a dominant logic that aimed to explain the world phenomena for over a hundred years; it was later challenged by other logicians who argued that it
