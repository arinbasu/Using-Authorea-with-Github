## The idea is to use authorea with github

1. First open up an article in Authorea
2. Next, set up the github key
3. Edit the article in github or in the desktop and sync with github
4. Commit changes and update
5. This should show up in Authorea

| Test | Findings |
|------|----------|
| X    | this is X |
| Y    | this is Y |

If this table shows us as it should then it is great. Next stop should be citations.

The citations should be ideally first started at Authorea and then ported over. Steps:

- Start the citations in Authorea
- Work on the citations using the latex modes of citing in Github
- Sync
