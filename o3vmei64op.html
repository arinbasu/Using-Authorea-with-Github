<div>So, incidence and prevalence estimate two different entities. Prevalence is suited for long term conditions to give you an idea of the magnitude of the problem, and incidence provides you an idea of the force at which a condition is developing in the population.&nbsp;</div><div>Sometimes, we are interested to know whether difference in the age or other structures in the two populations might be influencing the difference in the rates we find. In order to assess this situation, we need age-specific rates of the two or more populations that we'd like to compare and another population whose age structure we know. This method is referred to as age-standardisation. This is particularly useful in situations where we investigate clusters of cases of diseases in environmental health. For example, imagine you have received reports that cancer incidence rate has increased in a particular township since the introduction of a new plant. How do you know that whether the rates that are being reported are really too high when compared with the rest of the country? This is where standardisation of the rates become an important concept to learn.&nbsp;</div><div>We will illustrate the point of standardised rates using data sets from the NZ Ministry of Health for cancer cases for the years 2013, 2014, and 2015. <a href="http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/selected-cancers-2013-2014-2015" target="_blank">You can obtain the data sets from here</a></div>
