<div>So, incidence and prevalence estimate two different entities. Prevalence is suited for long term conditions to give you an idea of the magnitude of the problem, and incidence provides you an idea of the force at which a condition is developing in the population.&nbsp;</div><div>Sometimes, we are interested to know whether difference in the age or other structures in the two populations might be influencing the difference in the rates we find. In order to assess this situation, we need age-specific rates of the two or more populations that we'd like to compare and another population whose age structure we know. This method is referred to as age-standardisation. This is particularly useful in situations where we investigate clusters of cases of diseases in environmental health. For example, imagine you have received reports that cancer incidence rate has increased in a particular township since the introduction of a new plant. How do you know that whether the rates that are being reported are really too high when compared with the rest of the country? This is where standardisation of the rates become an important concept to learn.&nbsp;</div><div>We will illustrate the point of standardised rates using data sets from the NZ Ministry of Health for cancer cases for the years 2013, 2014, and 2015.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/selected-cancers-2013-2014-2015" target="_blank">You can obtain the data sets from here</a>. We will first illustrate by calculating age-standardised rates for breast cancers and then we will compare the ASRs for Leukemia, and melanoma, the two cancers that are linked to environmental variables.&nbsp;</div><div>We now discuss the principles of measures of association -- risk ratios, and odds ratios. As we discussed in the previous section, incidence rates are measures of risk, in the sense, that they express the likelihood that someone who does not have the disease has an instantaneous risk of developing the disease and incidence rates express that risk in the population. When the two incidence rates are compared, one among those who are not exposed and those who are exposed, that ratio is referred to as incidence rate ratios, or relative risks. Absolute risk refers to the difference in the incidence&nbsp;</div><div>In environmental and occupational epidemiology, we do not test the results of interventions as Environment is the source of exposure. Hence, we conduct three or four different types of epidemiological studies: ecological studies (secondary data analyses from primary data collected by the Government or others), case control studies either by themselves or case control studies that are nested within cohort studies, and cohort studies.&nbsp;</div><div>Ecological studies are those where data in aggregated forms are correlated. This is in the form of regression analyses or testing of linear models. Imagine you want to test your theory that Air Pollution causes Asthma. You would test your hypotheses that those who are exposed to poor air quality are more likely to get admitted to hospitals with Asthma related issues, or if nothing, Asthma symptoms would worsen during periods of poor air quality. In order to test this hypothesis, you would set up a study where you would correlate air quality indicators and rate or likelihood of hospital admissions with Asthma and related symptoms.&nbsp;</div><div>Ecological studies are useful&nbsp;</div><div>Ecological studies are limited in their scope</div><div>Cross sectional surveys are studies where a group of people are surveyed or interviewed at a given point in time or an extended period of time.&nbsp;</div><div>Case control studies are those studies where odds of exposure for cases are compared with the odds of exposure for controls. Cases and controls are as similar as possible, and the rule is that, if the controls were to develop the outcome of interest, then they would be labelled as cases.&nbsp;</div><div>Cohort studies are those where people are stratified into exposed and non-exposed groups and then they are followed through in time. For each cohort, the rate of occurrrence of the outcome are noted and these are compared using the rate ratio or relative risk estimate.&nbsp;</div><div>Retrospective cohort studies are those where the exposure and outcomes are ascertained at the same time, although it is presumed that the exposure preceded the outcome. Retrospective cohort studies are useful study designs for occupational epidemiological studies.</div><div>A case control study can be nested within a prospective or a retrospective or even within the scope of a cross-sectional survey. This is also referred to as serological study.&nbsp;</div><div>We analyse the results of the different epidemiological studies using different strategies. Our analysis depends on the nature of the outcomes we aim to study and the objectives of our study. In ecological study design, where air pollution and asthma health effects are studied, we use linear regression. for example, .... In case control and crosssectional surveys where we aim to regress the odds of exposure for those with and without outcomes, we use logistic regression. In logistic regression, .... In cohort studies, were time dependent events are mod</div>
