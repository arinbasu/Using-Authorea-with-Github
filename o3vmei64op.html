<div>So, incidence and prevalence estimate two different entities. Prevalence is suited for long term conditions to give you an idea of the magnitude of the problem, and incidence provides you an idea of the force at which a condition is developing in the population.&nbsp;</div><div>Sometimes, we are interested to know whether difference in the age or other structures in the two populations might be influencing the difference in the rates we find. In order to assess this situation, we need age-specific rates of the two or more populations that we'd like to compare and another population whose age structure we know. This method is referred to as age-standardisation. This is particularly useful in situations where we investigate clusters of cases of diseases in environmental health. For example, imagine you have received reports that cancer incidence rate has increased in a particular township since the introduction of a new plant. How do you know that whether the rates that are being reported are really too high when compared with the rest of the country? This is where standardisation of the rates become an important concept to learn.&nbsp;</div><div>We will illustrate the point of standardised rates using data sets from the NZ Ministry of Health for cancer cases for the years 2013, 2014, and 2015.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/selected-cancers-2013-2014-2015" target="_blank">You can obtain the data sets from here</a>. We will first illustrate by calculating age-standardised rates for breast cancers and then we will compare the ASRs for Leukemia, and melanoma, the two cancers that are linked to environmental variables.&nbsp;</div><div>We now discuss the principles of measures of association -- risk ratios, and odds ratios. As we discussed in the previous section, incidence rates are measures of risk, in the sense, that they express the likelihood that someone who does not have the disease has an instantaneous risk of developing the disease and incidence rates express that risk in the population. When the two incidence rates are compared, one among those who are not exposed and those who are exposed, that ratio is referred to as incidence rate ratios, or relative risks. Absolute risk refers to the difference in the incidence&nbsp;</div><div>In environmental and occupational epidemiology, we do not test the results of interventions as Environment is the source of exposure. Hence, we conduct three or four different types of epidemiological studies: ecological studies (secondary data analyses from primary data collected by the Government or others), case control studies either by themselves or case control studies that are nested within cohort studies, and cohort studies.&nbsp;</div><div>Ecological studies are those where data in aggregated forms are correlated. This is in the form of regression analyses or testing of linear models. Imagine you want to test your theory that Air Pollution causes Asthma. You would test your hypotheses that those who are exposed to poor air quality are more likely to get admitted to hospitals with Asthma related issues, or if nothing, Asthma sys</div>
