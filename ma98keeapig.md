We use this concept everyday in our scientific literature by using the test of hypotheses. As shown in the following table, we start with a null hypothesis and aim to reject the null hypothesis with our findings. 

| Observation | Null True | Null False          |
|-------------|-----------   |------------------|
| Reject Null | Type I Error | Correct          |
| Fail to reject Null | Correct | Type II Error |
