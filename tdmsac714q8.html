As you can see, Z is associated with both X and Y, but Z does not come in a causal connection that links X and Y. For example, in Nordic countries, Eero Pukkala and colleagues studied airline pilot who were considered to be at high risk of developing skin cancer as they flew over the poles and were exposed to high energy cosmic rays&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Pukkala_2002}</cite>. If you were to study this association, that is flying as an occupation and risk of death from cancer, you'd have to include gender as a confounding variable. Men are more likely to fly transcontinental aircrafts, and <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics" target="_blank">men are also more likely to die from cancers</a>.&nbsp;</div><div>You can control for confounding in many different ways. Before beginning a study, you can identify potential confounding variables, and then you can either restrict participants so that a potential confounding variable would be controlled for. In the airline pilot and cancer study, for example, you would only consider men. You could also match on specific variables. In case of the airline pilot and risk of cancer deaths, for example, you could take same number of men and women or the same proportion of men and women in the comparison arms. You can also control the role of potential confounding variables by conducting stratified analysis or conducting multivariable analysis. We will examine these examples in the section on data analysis for epidemiology.&nbsp;</div><div>In exploring the relationship between an exposure and a health outcome, if you can rule out the play of chance, eliminate biases before or at the stage of study design, and control for confounding variables either at the stage of study design or during the analysis of data, then you have established that the exposure has a valid association with the outcome. But what will help us to understand the nature of this association that this association is one of cause and effect?&nbsp;</div><div>This answer is not easy and as it happens, there is no easy way to understand this. One approach might be to consider several criteria and examine them to judge whether the association might be one of cause and effect. The reason this type of association is important is because if you know that X is a cause of Y, then you can state that if X is eliminated or if X is removed or if X is controlled for, then there would be a certain level in the diminution of Y as well. This is the basis of precautionary principle that is used in Environmental and Occupational health. Precautionary principle is a principle that states that even if we do not know the full extent of the association, if we know that some&nbsp;</div><div></div>
