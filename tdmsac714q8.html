As you can see, Z is associated with both X and Y, but Z does not come in a causal connection that links X and Y. For example, in Nordic countries, Eero Pukkala and colleagues studied airline pilot who were considered to be at high risk of developing skin cancer as they flew over the poles and were exposed to high energy cosmic rays&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Pukkala_2002}</cite>. If you were to study this association, that is flying as an occupation and risk of death from cancer, you'd have to include gender as a confounding variable. Men are more likely to fly transcontinental aircrafts, and <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics" target="_blank">men are also more likely to die from cancers</a>.&nbsp;</div><div>You can control for confounding in many different ways. Before beginning a study, you can identify potential confounding variables, and then you can either restrict participants so that a potential confounding variable would be controlled for. In the airline pilot and cancer study, for example, you would only consider men. You c</div>
